# GosenKit

Patch management library for the Kawai K5000 Advanced Additive Synthesizer

This package needs a lot more comments and unit tests. It can be used for experiments, but it is not ready for production use,
although I'm trying to adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

The word "gosen" 五千 is Japanese for 5,000.

## Test resources

This package contains some System Exclusive files to use in unit tests. They are packaged as described in [Bundling Resources
with a Swift Package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package).
This feature requires Swift 5.3.
